It is flanked on the north by Reseda and the Sepulveda Basin, on the east by Sherman Oaks, on the southeast by Bel-Air, on the south by Brentwood and on the west by Tarzana. Encino has a small town feel, with amenities within walking distance. The average lot size is bigger than other areas of the city, making certain blocks very quiet and rural. The main area for shopping and dining is situated on Ventura Blvd. between White Oak and Balboa, an area called the Encino Commons, dubbed The Valley’s Miracle Mile, and home to more than 300 businesses. If you like Middle Eastern fare, you can visit a few places including Sadaf, specializing in kabobs and eggplant. For groceries, there’s Ralph’s, Gelson’s, or Super Sal Market down the boulevard, which features Israeli and kosher foods. Encino is anchored by several areas of lush parkland, including the 5-acre Los Encinos State Historic Park, the Sepulveda Dam, and Sepulveda Gardens. Dog owners can enjoy the off-leash Sepulveda Basin Dog Park. There’s also a sports complex with a baseball field and several golf courses. So there’s plenty to do outdoors!</p>

Tarzana is on the site of a former ranch owned by author Edgar Rice Burroughs and is named after Burroughs' fictional jungle hero, Tarzan. There are a number of celebrities and well-renowned writers and artists that live in Tarzana because of the grand houses, incredible views from the mountains, and relative seclusion. It's a bit off of the beaten path from the main Los Angeles area and the Melody Acres part of Tarzana really feels like it's not a part of the city at all. It's very tranquil, has a lot of nature and the houses are quite spread apart. There are a couple of country clubs in Tarzana, and there's plenty of hiking and horse riding to be had. So, the fitness and fresh air aspect of the place is pretty unbeatable considering it's part of a major city.</p>
