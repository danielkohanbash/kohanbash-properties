              <p class="text">
                Daniel is an alumni of the University of Southern California
                Marshal School of Business where he graduated with Honors
                receiving a B.S. in Business Administration with an emphasis in
                Real Estate Finance. <br />
                At a very young age, Daniel realized that Real Estate was his
                calling. His involvement, dates back to his childhood in which
                he would accompany his parents to open houses. Daniel can
                confidently admit that he has extensive knowledge of the Los
                Angeles Real Estate Market. <br /><br />
                Daniel understands that buying or selling a home is more than
                just a transaction: it’s a life-changing experience. That’s why,
                Daniel is dedicated to providing exceptional, personalized
                service for all of his clients. He takes great pride in the
                relationships he builds and always works relentlessly on the
                client’s behalf to help them achieve their real estate goals.
                <br /><br />
                Before Compass, Daniel worked at Keller Williams as a senior
                associate,Township Capital,Achieve Real Estate and Management
                and Marcus and Millichap.
                <br /><br />
                Daniel’s past experience at Marcus and Millichap and his
                education, gives him the skills to not only look at a property
                from a homeowner standpoint but also, an investment standpoint.
                He understands the requirements needed from investors to make
                their ventures into a profitable return on investment. His
                experience coupled with his education, makes him an outstanding
                agent. <br /><br />
                Daniel’s time out of the office are usually spent alongside
                family and friends, volunteering with individuals with special
                needs, and playing basketball.
              </p>

                <strong> Daniel's Promise To His Clients:</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Daniel's philosophy is simple: clients come first. He pledges to
                be in constant communication with his clients, keeping them
                fully informed throughout the entire buying or selling process.
                He believes that if you’re not left with an amazing experience,
                he hasn't done his job. He doesn’t measure success through
                achievements or awards, but through the satisfaction of his
                clients.
